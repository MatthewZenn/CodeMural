SandTable is a JavaScript-based canvas art program. Use the built-in text editor to code visuals to the fullscreen canvas. The ```canvas``` and ```ctx``` variables are already defined in the code, as well as a ```sleep``` function. Leaving you to take it from there.

As of it's current version, the resolution of the canvas cannot be changed.

**TODO**
- Saving Code
- Saving images of artwork or textures
